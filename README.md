# Pathfinder.js: A Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

## Background
Pathfinding comes up in a variety of contexts, from role-playing games to ride-sharing apps.
The basic setup is as follows: given a graph (a list of connected nodes), a
starting node and a goal node, we want to find the shortest path from the start
to the goal.

Pathfinder.js is an interactive visualization tool that aims to demonstrate
functionality and efficiency of four such algorithms:
  * Breadth First Search:
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm:
  * Greedy Best-First Search:
  * A\* Algorithm

The project was built in four days with:
  * Vanilla JavaScript
  * [EaselJS][easel] for the visualizations
  * [jQuery][jquery] for DOM manipulation

customizable way. The start and end

### Obstacle Presets

### Functional, Efficiently Implemented, Algorithms


## Future Directions




- Breadth First Search and A\*.
Breadth First Search is a brute-force, slow, algorithm, while A* is significantly more efficient, and the standard choice in various real-world
pathfinding scenarios.
